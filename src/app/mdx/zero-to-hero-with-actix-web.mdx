# Zero to Hero with Actix Web

## Introduction

Actix Web is a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust.
It is built on top of Actix, a powerful actor framework for Rust. Actix Web is
designed to be fast, modular, and easy to use. It is a great choice for building
web applications, APIs, and microservices in Rust.

In this tutorial, we will build a simple web application using Actix Web. We
will cover the basics of Actix Web, including routing, request handling,
middleware, and more. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a good
understanding of how to build web applications with Actix Web.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, make sure you have the following installed on your
system:

-   [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
-   [Install Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html)

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Create a New Actix Web Project

To create a new Actix Web project, run the following command:

```bash

cargo new <project-name>
cd <project-name>

```

### Step 2: Add Actix Web as a Dependency

Add Actix Web as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

```toml

[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.0.0"

```

### Step 3: Create a Basic Actix Web Application

Create a new file called main.rs in the src directory and add the following
code:

```rust

async fn hello() -> impl Responder {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hey there!")
}

```

### Step 4: Add Scope and Routes to the Application

Add a scope and routes to the application in the main.rs file:

```rust

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new().service(
            web::scope("/api/v1/")
                // Define routes here
        )
    })
    .bind(("127.0.0.1", 8080))?
    .run()
    .await
}

```

### Step 5: Add Diesel ORM as a Dependency

Add Diesel ORM as a dependency in your Cargo.toml file:

```toml

[dependencies]
diesel = { version = "2.2.0", features = ["postgres"] }

```

If you feel more comfortable using a terminal to add the dependency, you can run
the following command:

```bash

cargo add diesel --features postgres

```

### Step 6: Installing Diesel CLI

To install the Diesel CLI, run the following command:

```bash

cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres

```

This step can often be a bit tricky, so I recommend checking the official Diesel
documentation for more detailed instructions.
[Diesel Documentation](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started)

### Step 7: Configure Diesel

First create a .env file in the root of your project and add the following:

```bash

echo DATABASE_URL=postgres://username:password@localhost/dbname > .env

```

Next, run the following command to configure Diesel:

```bash

diesel setup

```

### Step 8: Create a Migration File for the Database

To create a migration file for the database, run the following command:

```bash

diesel migration generate create_todos

```

This will create a new migration file in the migrations directory. Open the
migration file and add the following code:

```sql

CREATE TABLE todos (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);

```

```sql

DROP TABLE todos;

```

We can apply our new migrations to the database by running the following
command:

```bash

diesel migration run

```

It is always a good idea to check if down.sql is correct. You can quicly confirm
this by running:

```bash

diesel migration redo

```

Ensure that the migration was successful by checking the database. You can use a
tool like pgAdmin or a command-line tool like psql to check the database.

### Step 9: Write Some Code to Connect to the Database

Create a new file called lib.rs in the src directory and add the following code:

```rust

use diesel::pg::PgConnection;
use diesel::prelude::*;
use dotenv::dotenv;
use std::env;

pub fn establish_connection() -> PgConnection {
    dotenv().ok();

    let database_url = env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("DATABASE_URL must be set");
    PgConnection::establish(&database_url)
        .unwrap_or_else(|_| panic!("Error connecting to {}", database_url))
}

```

### Step 10: Create a Model for the Database Table

Create a new file called models.rs in the src directory and add the following
code:

```rust

use diesel::prelude::*;

#[derive(Queryable, Selectable)]
#[diesel(table_name = crate::schema::todos)]
#[diesel(check_for_backend(diesel::pg::Pg))]

pub struct Todo {
    pub id: i32,
    pub title: String,
    pub body: String,
    pub completed: bool,
    pub created_at: NaiveDateTime,
    pub updated_at: NaiveDateTime,
}

```

### Step 11: Writing Queries

Create a new file called queries.rs in the src directory and add the following
code:

```rust

use diesel::prelude::*;
use crate::models::Todo;

pub fn get_todos(conn: &PgConnection) -> Vec<Todo> {
    use crate::schema::todos::dsl::*;

    todos.load::<Todo>(conn).expect("Error loading todos")
}

pub fn create_todo<'a>(
    conn: &PgConnection,
    title: &'a str,
    body: &'a str,
    completed: bool,
) -> Todo {
    use crate::schema::todos;

    let new_todo = NewTodo {
        title,
        body,
        completed,
    };

    diesel::insert_into(todos::table)
        .values(&new_todo)
        .get_result(conn)
        .expect("Error saving new todo")
}

pub fn update_todo<'a>(
    conn: &PgConnection,
    id: i32,
    title: &'a str,
    body: &'a str,
    completed: bool,
) -> Todo {
    use crate::schema::todos::dsl::*;

    diesel::update(todos.find(id))
        .set((title.eq(title), body.eq(body), completed.eq(completed)))
        .get_result(conn)
        .expect(&format!("Unable to find todo {}", id))
}

pub fn delete_todo(conn: &PgConnection, id: i32) -> bool {
    use crate::schema::todos::dsl::*;

    diesel::delete(todos.find(id))
        .execute(conn)
        .is_ok()
}

```

### Step 12: Add Queries to Handlers in the Application

Add queries to handlers in the application in the main.rs file:

```rust

async fn get_todos() -> impl Responder {
    let conn = establish_connection();
    let todos = queries::get_todos(&conn);

    HttpResponse::Ok().json(todos)
}

async fn create_todo() -> impl Responder {
    let conn = establish_connection();
    let new_todo = queries::create_todo(&conn, "New Todo", "This is a new todo", false);

    HttpResponse::Created().json(new_todo)
}

async fn update_todo() -> impl Responder {
    let conn = establish_connection();
    let updated_todo = queries::update_todo(&conn, 1, "Updated Todo", "This is an updated todo", true);

    HttpResponse::Ok().json(updated_todo)
}

async fn delete_todo() -> impl Responder {
    let conn = establish_connection();
    let result = queries::delete_todo(&conn, 1);

    if result {
        HttpResponse::Ok().body("Todo deleted successfully")
    } else {
        HttpResponse::InternalServerError().body("Error deleting todo")
    }
}

```

### Step 13: Run the Application

Add route handlers to the application in the main.rs file:

```rust

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new().service(
            web::scope("/api/v1/")
                .route("/todo", web::get().to(get_todos))
                .route("/todo", web::post().to(create_todo))
                .route("/todo/{id}", web::get().to(get_todo))
                .route("/todo/{id}", web::put().to(update_todo))
                .route("/todo/{id}", web::delete().to(delete_todo)
            )
        )
    })
}


```

### Step 6: Run the Application

Run the application using the following command:

```bash

cargo run

```
